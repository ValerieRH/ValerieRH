## Network Projects
### [Small Office Network with VLANs] (https://github.com/ValerieRH/ValerieRH/blob/main/Small-Office-Vlans/small-office-vlans)
**Tech:** Cisco Packet Tracer, 802.1Q encapsulation, Broadcast domains, default gateways, VLAN tagging, and Access and Trunking ports.
* **Objective:** Designed a small office network to securely segment Sales and HR departments.
* **Key Win:** Successfully implemented a VLAN-based network segmentation accross multiple switches. I extended the topology to a router-on-a-stick design, creating sub-interfaces to enable controlled communication between VLANs.
